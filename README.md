# Precision-Recall-Tradeoff
Precision/Recall Tradeoff

Precision score: It is a factor that told exactness of the model For example if a model is predicting patients suffering from cancer how many are predicted as positive. Formula is TP/TP+FP
If I want to get high precision score I have to lower false positive
Recall score: The factor which told the completeness of the model in other words measure of the model correctly identifying True Positives. For my example recall gives information about how accurately our model is able to identify the cancer positive. Formula is TP/TP+FN
If I want to get high recall score I have to lower false negative.
